## Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting 
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating a working sheet and transforming the datasets presented in different sheets into "Tables". After this we start getting to explore the data and check for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors.
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

## Data Analysis

pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as product category, store location, product type. 

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" were added.

## Project Conclusion

the analysis of monthly sales, transaction trends, and product categories across three stores provides valuable insights into the business performance. Interestingly, Lower Manhattan, while making the least in revenue, makes the most during peak hours compared to the other stores. Astoria makes the most during non-peak hours compared to the other stores despite reduced operational hours. All stores are close to each other in terms revenue generated. This comprehensive analysis equips the business with actionable insights for optimizing operations and maximizing revenue across all three locations.
